# Design Guidelines: 1:1 Repository Copy

## Design Approach: EXACT REPLICATION

**Critical Directive:** This project requires a precise 1:1 copy of the existing NEWweb3 repository. No creative interpretation, no improvements, no modifications.

## Design Strategy

**Reference-Based Approach:** Direct replication of existing codebase
- Copy all visual styling exactly as implemented
- Maintain identical component structure
- Preserve all existing interactions and animations
- Keep WebGPU scanning effect implementation unchanged

## Core Design Elements

### Typography
- Use exact font specifications from existing Tailwind config
- Maintain all font weights, sizes, and line heights as currently implemented
- Preserve text hierarchy exactly as found in source files

### Layout System  
- Replicate spacing units from existing Tailwind configuration
- Match all padding, margin, and gap values precisely
- Maintain responsive breakpoints as configured

### Component Library
- Copy all React components without modification
- Preserve WebGPU scanning effect with depth maps exactly as implemented
- Maintain all existing UI elements, forms, and interactive components
- Keep navigation patterns identical

### Visual Treatment
- Replicate existing design system choices
- Match styling decisions from src directory
- Preserve all CSS and Tailwind classes exactly

### Animations
- Maintain WebGPU scanning effect precisely as coded
- Copy all animation timing, easing, and choreography
- Preserve depth map interactions without changes

## Implementation Notes

**Critical:** Every file, style, configuration, and visual element must match the source repository exactly. This is a cloning task, not a design task.
